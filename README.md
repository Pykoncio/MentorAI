# VisionRL  
Training a reinforcement learning agent in a simulator using CNNs for decision-making.  

## 🚀 Project Status  
This project is currently **Under Development**. Stay tuned for updates!  

## 📌 Goals  
- Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process visual input.  
- Train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent in a simulated environment.  
- Optimize decision-making through deep learning techniques.  

## 🛠️ Setup (Coming Soon)  
Instructions on setting up the project will be added soon.
